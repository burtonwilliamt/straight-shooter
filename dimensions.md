## Pool table

We'll go for a 9' table (because we're playing professional pool here). It's 50" x 100"

A pool ball has a diameter of 2.25" (57mm). This means the playable area of the table is 22.222 balls tall, or 44.44 balls tall


The recommended room size is 16'4" x 12'2" (196" x 146"). If we use 7 pixels per inch, we get a total room size of (1372px X 1022px) which assuming 1920 x 1080 game size leaves us 548 pixels for a sidebar, and 58 pixels for top/bottom spacing.

This suggest our table should have an inner area of size 700px by 350px, and an outer area size of 798px by 448px. The balls should be size 16px square. For ease of math, I'll round it to 800px by 450px total, with a bumper of 50px.
